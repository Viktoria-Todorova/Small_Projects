🎓 Interactive Data Type Operations System

Welcome to my interactive Python project ! In this exercise, I will create a dynamic script where I get to choose a data type and perform related operations. The goal is to reinforce my understanding of Python data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, by implementing different actions based on my input.

🌟 Project Overview
I will write a Python program that:

1. Prompts the user to select a data type from a list of choices.
2. Based on the user’s selection, performs specific operations related to that data type.
3. Provides meaningful output and handles edge cases (like dividing by zero or modifying an immutable type).
   
✅ This project is  to give me hands-on experience with fundamental Python concepts while making it fun and interactive! 💡

🛠 Skills i Practiced

- **String manipulation** 🧵
- **Basic arithmetic** and **number handling** ➕➖✖️➗
- **Boolean logic** 🤔 (AND, OR, NOT)
- **Working with lists, tuples, and dictionaries** 📋🗂️
- **Error handling** 🚫
- **User input & output** 🖥️

➡ [**Also the project with extra spice**](https://github.com/Viktoria-Todorova/Small_Projects/blob/Projects/Interactive_data_type/Interactive_data_type_extras.py) I added colors to make it easier to the user to read and separate the different steps of the choices i give him
