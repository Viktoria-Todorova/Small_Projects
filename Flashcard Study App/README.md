## Project Overview

The **Flashcard Study App** is a Python-based project where students create, organize, and review flashcards to study various topics. The app will utilize dictionaries to store flashcards, each containing a question and answer pair. This project helps students build practical skills in dictionary management, as they perform tasks like adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting flashcards from a dictionary database.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain experience using Python dictionaries to store, update, and retrieve data.
- Practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on dictionary entries.
- Build a text-based application that simulates a digital flashcard review experience.
- Implement user interaction for real-time flashcard creation, review, and management.
