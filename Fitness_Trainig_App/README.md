## Project Overview

The Fitness Training App is a Python project where I applied object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The app lets users create and manage workout routines, track their progress, and monitor their fitness journey.

## Learning Objectives

Understand OOP concepts 🧑‍💻: I focused on core OOP ideas like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Design a system 🛠️: I built a system that handles users, exercises, workout routines, and progress tracking.
Organize Python code 📂: I learned how to split the code into different modules, keeping everything clear and reusable.
