 📝 📝 The number guessing game is implemented using Python for its simplicity and readability. It utilizes the `random` library to generate a number for each level, with loops and conditionals to manage game flow and provide feedback based on player input. User input is validated to ensure valid numbers are entered. The extra game features multiple levels, each increasing in difficulty, and limits the number of guesses per level. Hints are provided after a few incorrect guesses to assist the player. This solution effectively combines programming concepts and user interaction for an engaging game experience.

## 🧭How to Play🧭

 [**Code for Simple Game**](https://github.com/Viktoria-Todorova/Small_Projects/blob/Projects/Guess_a_number/guess_a_number.py)
 
🎮 Start the Game: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

🚫 Input Validation: If you enter something that's not a number, you’ll be asked to try again.

📉📈 Feedback: After each guess, you’ll be told if your guess is "Too low" 📉 or "Too high" 📈.

🏆 Winning: When you guess the number correctly, the game will display "You guessed it!" and end.

## 🧭How to Play🧭

 [**Code With extra levels**](https://github.com/Viktoria-Todorova/Small_Projects/blob/Projects/Guess_a_number/guess_a_number_extra.py)
 
🎮 Start the Game: Type "yes" to start or "no" to stop. There are 10 levels in total.

🎯 Objective: Guess the randomly generated number for each level within a range of 1 to (Level * 100).

🔄 Attempts: You have 8 tries per level. After 3 incorrect guesses, you’ll get a hint (even or odd).

📉📈 Feedback: After each guess, you’ll be told if the number is "too high" 📈 or "too low" 📉.

🏆 Winning: Guess correctly to advance to the next level. The game tracks how many levels you've won.

❌ Losing: If you use all 8 attempts without guessing the number, the game ends and shows the correct answer.

🍀 Enjoy and good luck! 🍀
